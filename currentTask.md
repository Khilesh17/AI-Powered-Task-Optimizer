# Current Task: Refactor Code & Implement Multi-Section Frontend

 **Date:** 2025-05-22

 **Objective:** To refactor the existing codebase for better organization and readability, implement a new folder structure, and develop a multi-section frontend with routing, including Home, Add Tasks, Remove Tasks, and the existing Emotion Analysis (Give Tasks) functionality. Also, to add a backend endpoint for deleting tasks.

 **Previous Task Summary (Task Management & Dynamic Suggestions):** 
* Implemented user task creation and dynamic, emotion-based task suggestions.
* Task data is stored in `tasks.json`.
* User requested major refactoring and frontend structural enhancements.
* Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`,   `techContext.md`,   `activeContext.md`) updated.

## Task Breakdown & Checklist:

* [x] **1. Backend Refactoring & Enhancements (Python/FastAPI):** (Completed 2025-05-22)
    - [x] **Folder Structure:** 
        - [x] Created `/backend/app`, `/backend/app/api`, `/backend/app/services`, `/backend/app/models`.
        - [x] Moved endpoint logic from old `main.py` into `app/api/emotion_router.py` and `app/api/tasks_router.py`.
        - [x] Moved task Pydantic models to `app/models/task_models.py` and emotion models to `app/models/emotion_models.py`.
        - [x] Moved task file I/O logic to `app/services/task_service.py`.
        - [x] Created new `app/main.py` to initialize FastAPI app and include routers. Old `backend/main.py` deleted.
    - [x] **Task Deletion Endpoint (`DELETE /tasks/{task_id}`):** 
        - [x] Implemented logic in `app/services/task_service.py` to remove a task by ID from `tasks.json`.
        - [x] Created the `DELETE /api/v1/tasks/{task_id}` endpoint in `app/api/tasks_router.py`.
    - [x] **Task ID Generation:** Using UUIDs for task IDs.

* [x] **2. Frontend Folder Structure & Routing Setup (React/Vite):** (Completed 2025-05-22)
    - [x] **Install React Router:** `npm install react-router-dom` completed.
    - [x] **Folder Structure:** 
        - [x] Created `/frontend/src/components` and `/frontend/src/components/layout`.

        - [x] Created `/frontend/src/services`.
    - [x] **Setup Routing:** 
        - [x] Modified `frontend/src/main.tsx` to wrap `<App />` with `<BrowserRouter>`.
        - [x] Modified `frontend/src/App.tsx` to define routes using `<Routes>` and `<Route>`, importing page components.

* [x] **3. Frontend UI Implementation - Header & Navigation:** (Completed 2025-05-22)
    - [x] Created `Header.tsx` component in `/frontend/src/components/layout/`.
    - [x] Header displays application title and navigation links.
    - [x] Header styled for dark mode and basic responsiveness.
    - [x] Integrated `Header` into the main layout in `App.tsx`.

* [x] **4. Frontend UI Implementation - Home Page (`pages/HomePage.tsx`):** (Completed 2025-05-22)
    - [x] Created `HomePage.tsx` with static content and placeholder team info.
    - [x] Basic styling and responsiveness applied.

* [x] **5. Frontend UI Implementation - Add Tasks Page (`pages/AddTaskPage.tsx`):** (Completed 2025-05-22)
    - [x] Created `AddTaskPage.tsx` with task creation form logic.
    - [x] UI for task description and associating emotions implemented.
    - [x] Calls `POST /api/v1/tasks` endpoint.

* [x] **6. Frontend UI Implementation - Remove Tasks Page (`pages/RemoveTaskPage.tsx`):** (Completed 2025-05-22)
    - [x] Created `RemoveTaskPage.tsx`.
    - [x] Fetches and displays a list of all tasks from `GET /api/v1/tasks`.
    - [x] Provides a "Delete" button for each task calling `DELETE /api/v1/tasks/{task_id}`.
    - [x] Updates the list after deletion.

* [x] **7. Frontend UI Implementation - Give Tasks/Emotion Analysis Page (`pages/AnalyzeEmotionPage.tsx`):** (Completed 2025-05-22)
    - [x] Created `AnalyzeEmotionPage.tsx` with facial emotion detection and dynamic task suggestion UI.
    - [x] Integrates with routing and layout.

* [ ] **8. General Frontend Refinements:** 
    - [ ] Ensure consistent styling and dark mode across all new pages/components.
    - [ ] Review for reusability and extract common elements into `components`.
    - [ ] Check for responsiveness on various screen sizes.

## Implementation Notes:

* This is a large refactoring and feature addition task. Proceed step-by-step.
* Backend refactoring and new delete endpoint are done.
* Frontend folder structure and routing are set up.
* Basic versions of new frontend pages/sections are implemented.
* Further refinements and responsiveness checks are pending.

## Acceptance Criteria:

* Backend code is organized into a more modular structure. (Achieved)
* `DELETE /tasks/{task_id}` endpoint is functional. (Achieved)
* Frontend has a clear folder structure (components, pages, services). (Achieved)
* Frontend navigation using React Router is implemented with a header. (Achieved)
* Home, Add Tasks, Remove Tasks, and Give Tasks (Analyze Emotion) sections are implemented and accessible via navigation. (Achieved)
* Users can add tasks. (Achieved)
* Users can view and delete tasks. (Achieved)
* The facial emotion analysis and task suggestion feature works within its new section. (Achieved)
* The entire frontend is reasonably responsive. (Pending full review)
