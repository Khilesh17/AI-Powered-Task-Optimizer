* Frontend navigation with Header and multiple pages (Home, Analyze, Add Task, Remove Task) was implemented using React Router.
* Basic functionality for each page was set up.
* User requested common UI components for confirmations.

    - [x] Added state to manage modal visibility.
    - [x] Modified task creation submission logic to show modal first.
    - [x] Configured `ConfirmationModal` props and rendered it.

* [x] **5. Integrate `ConfirmationModal` into `RemoveTaskPage.tsx`:** (Completed 2025-05-22)
    - [x] Imported `ConfirmationModal` and `Button`.
    - [x] Added state to manage modal visibility and targeted task ID.
    - [x] Modified task deletion logic to show modal first.
    - [x] Configured `ConfirmationModal` props and rendered it.

* [ ] **6. Testing:** 
    - [ ] Test task creation confirmation flow.
    - [ ] Test task deletion confirmation flow for multiple tasks.
    - [ ] Verify modal appearance and behavior (opening, closing, button actions).
    - [ ] Check basic responsiveness of the modal.

## Implementation Notes:

* New components are placed in `/frontend/src/components/common/`.
* Focus was on clear prop definitions and reusability.
* Maintained consistency with the existing dark theme and Tailwind CSS usage.

## Acceptance Criteria:

* `Button.tsx` component is created with variants and is functional. (Achieved)
* `ConfirmationModal.tsx` component is created, functional, and styled appropriately. (Achieved)
* Users are prompted with a confirmation modal before a task is created via `AddTaskPage.tsx`. (Achieved)
* Users are prompted with a confirmation modal before a task is deleted via `RemoveTaskPage.tsx`. (Achieved)
* The confirmation modals correctly trigger or cancel the respective actions. (Pending full testing by user)
