# Active Context: TaskNova

## Current Focus: Common UI Components & Integration

**Date:** 2025-05-22

**Status:** Continuing frontend enhancements. User requested creation of common Button and ConfirmationModal components and their integration.

## Recent Decisions & Key Insights:

1.  **Project Name:** TaskNova.
2.  **Core Goal (Current Phase):** Create reusable Button and ConfirmationModal components. Integrate modal for task creation and deletion confirmations. Ensure consistent styling.
3.  **Technology Stack (Confirmed):
    *   **Frontend:** React with Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Router.
    *   **Backend:** Python with FastAPI.
    *   **Task Storage:** Local JSON file (`tasks.json`).
    *   **ML:** Pre-trained facial emotion recognition model (`deepface`).
4.  **Expanded Scope (Current Phase):
    *   **Common Button Component:** Create `Button.tsx` with variants.
    *   **Confirmation Modal Component:** Create `ConfirmationModal.tsx` for user confirmations.
    *   **Integration:** Use `ConfirmationModal` in `AddTaskPage.tsx` and `RemoveTaskPage.tsx`.
    *   **Code Refactoring:** (Ongoing) Organize frontend and backend code into logical folder structures.
    *   **Frontend Navigation:** (Completed) Implemented header and routing.
    *   **Home, Add/Remove Tasks, Analyze Pages:** (Basic versions implemented).
    *   **Responsiveness:** (Ongoing, to be reviewed).
    *   **Backend Task Deletion:** (Completed) Implemented `DELETE /tasks/{task_id}` endpoint.
5.  **Architectural Approach:** Modular Monolith (as per `systemPatterns.md`), with new Task Management capabilities.

## Next Steps:

1.  Update `currentTask.md` to detail implementation of `Button.tsx` and `ConfirmationModal.tsx` and their integration.
2.  Update `progress.md` with these new component development milestones.
3.  Proceed with implementation in Act Mode.

## Resolved Questions:

-   Frontend preference: SvelteKit.
-   Backend preference: Python with FastAPI (reverted for CV).
-   Infrastructure/Constraints: Focus on local development first, simple cloud deployment later if needed. No complex constraints for MVP.
-   ML Model preference: Pre-trained facial emotion recognition model.
-   MVP Priorities: Confirmed focus on facial emotion detection, basic task suggestion, and mood logging.
-   Third-party integrations: None for MVP.
